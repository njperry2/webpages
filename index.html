    <p>My name is Nicholas Perry, and I am an undergraduate junior majoring in Electrical and
    Computer Engineering. The allure of this major for me is deeply rooted in my profound 
    passion for mathematics, physics, and computers. From a young age, I've always been 
    captivated by the magic of computations, spending countless hours in front of a computer
    screen. This blend of interests naturally guided me towards the field I'm in today, seeking to 
    harness the power of both electrical systems and computational technology.</p>

    <p>I currently work for the ASSIST lab at NC State. At the ASSIST lab, I work as an undergraduate 
    researcher. Our lab is centered on developing wearable sensors designed to collect health marker data.
    These sensors are utilized both for human patients and animals. The goal is to enhance health
     monitoring through technological advancements.</p>
